# Tweeter Project

A simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.

## Technical Approach & Objectives

The server is built with Node and Express and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. The server/express code should not require any change from the student.

Implementation of HTML, CSS and client-side JS brings this project to life.
